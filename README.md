# ElectroGraph

ElectroGraph is a simple web application that allows users to visualize pure electrical circuits (resistive, capacitive and inductive) by entering the values of the electrical components and the parameters of the voltage generator.

You can try it out [here](https://landiluigi746.github.io/ElectroGraph/).

## Architecture

The application is built using [React](https://react.dev/), along with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, [PrimeReact](https://primereact.org/) for UI components and [function-plot](https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/) for plotting the graphs.

## Local setup

To setup the project locally, run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository and enter the directory
git clone https://github.com/landiluigi746/ElectroGraph.git
cd ElectroGraph

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Now you can open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to test the application.
